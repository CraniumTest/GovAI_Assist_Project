# GovAI Assist - Project Overview

## Introduction

The GovAI Assist project is designed to build a platform leveraging large language models (LLM) to facilitate communication between government agencies and citizens. By utilizing advanced natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques, the system aims to automate and streamline public service engagements, improve policy understanding, and enhance crisis management capabilities.

## Project Structure

The GovAI Assist implementation comprises several key components, each fulfilling a specific function in the overall system. Below is an overview of the main directories and their purposes:

1. **Backend:**
   - **Purpose:** Handles the server-side operations of the platform including routing, user management, and interfacing with the NLP components.
   - **Technology:** Built using the Flask framework to provide a scalable and efficient web service.
   - **Key File:** `app.py` - The main file for the Flask application, setting up the routes and server configuration.

2. **Frontend:**
   - **Purpose:** Develops the user interface where citizens and government officials interact with the portal.
   - **Technology:** Placeholder file indicating future development using web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript frameworks (e.g., React or Vue.js).
   - **Key File:** `index.html` - A basic HTML file serving as the placeholder for future frontend development.

3. **NLP:**
   - **Purpose:** Conducts text processing tasks to extract and summarize information from documents submitted by users.
   - **Technology:** Utilizes spaCy library for natural language understanding.
   - **Key File:** `document_processing.py` - A script for document summarization, providing a simple text analysis function.

4. **Database:**
   - **Purpose:** Manages data storage for user information, submitted documents, and interactions within the system.
   - **Technology:** SQL database for structured data management, with PostgreSQL as a likely candidate for implementation.
   - **Key File:** `setup.sql` - Script to initialize database tables for users and document management.

## Requirements

The project includes a `requirements.txt` file listing essential Python packages needed for development and execution. This encompasses web frameworks, NLP libraries, and database connectors to ensure the functional components of the system are well-integrated.

## Development Roadmap

1. **Prototype Development:**
   - Set up a basic application interface with core functionalities like query handling and document summarization.
   - Establish backend and database connections.

2. **Pilot Testing:**
   - Roll out a trial version for select users to gather feedback and make iterative improvements.

3. **Feature Expansion:**
   - Enhance language support, refine engagement tools, and integrate more complex analytics for policy feedback.

4. **Full Deployment:**
   - Implement across multiple government interfaces, with continuous monitoring and updates.

## Conclusion

The GovAI Assist project aims to harness state-of-the-art AI technologies to improve the interaction between government entities and citizens, ensuring a more efficient, transparent, and accessible public service system. This README provides an overview of the initial project setup, guiding future development and deployment phases.
